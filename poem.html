        <h2>A Poem for Cici</h2>
        <p>
            In the vast expanse of time, there stands a woman, unique to me,<br>
            A woman of trust, one who sets my heart free.<br>
            She differs from others, a rarity indeed,<br>
            In her, I find solace, my deepest need.<br><br>

            To the heavens, I proclaim, I desire her, it's true,<br>
            Not for her looks, nor her body's hue.<br>
            Not for loneliness or a heart left to roam,<br>
            But to show her she's worthy, to bring her home.<br><br>

            To reveal to her love's true form, pure and serene,<br>
            To make her special, in my eyes, a queen.<br>
            To spend our days in laughter and mirth,<br>
            Creating memories, defining our worth.<br><br>

            Together we'll journey, through rough and through tough,<br>
            To be her refuge, when the seas get rough.<br>
            To be her sanctuary, her place of reprieve,<br>
            Where she finds solace, in the love we conceive.<br><br>

            For she deserves a love, genuine and grand,<br>
            A love so pure, as if crafted by hand.<br>
            I confess, I've loved before, only to be hurt,<br>
            But now I've found her, my soul's true concert.<br><br>

            If she were to hurt me, where would I turn?<br>
            For in her, my heart finds its burn.<br>
            I've said it once, and I'll say it again,<br>
            "If not you, no one," my heart does explain.<br><br>

            I've pledged to myself, in the name of the Divine,<br>
            With her, my love will eternally shine.<br>
            And now, as she celebrates another year's grace,<br>
            Happy Birthday, dear Cici, in love's embrace.<br><br>
